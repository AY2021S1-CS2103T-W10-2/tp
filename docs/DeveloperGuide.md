## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteR 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`,`IngredientListPanel`,`ConsumptionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework and JFoenix components. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WishfulShrinkingParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteF 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteF 1` Command](images/DeleteIngredientSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteIngredientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the wishful shrinking data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `WishfulShrinking`, which `Recipe` references. This allows `WishfulShrinking` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the wishful shrinking data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on the implementation of certain features.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 
All the lifeline with the destroy marker (x) should be end with the mark (x) but due to a limitation of 
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Add features
Add features (`Add Recipe` and `Add Ingredient`) allows users to add the recipes and ingredients into their respective collection list.

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `AddRecipeCommand` and  `AddIngredientCommand` extends `Command`
* `AddRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddRecipeCommand>`
* `AddIngredientCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddIngredientCommand>`

The following sequence diagram shows how add operation works when 
`execute(addR n/Salad i/Veggies - 100g img/images/healthy3.jpg instr/Eat tag/healthy)` 
or 
`execute("addF i/tomato")`
API call:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/AddSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* AddCommandParser : `AddRecipeCommandParser` or `AddIngredientCommandParser`
* info: `n/Salad i/Veggies - 100g img/images/healthy3.jpg instr/Eat tag/healthy` or `i/tomato`
* add(type): `addRecipe(type)` or `addIngredient(type)`
* type: `recipe` or `ingredient`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs add recipe/ingredients command to add recipe/ingredients into the recipe list/fridge.

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `AddRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)` or `AddIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The recipe/ingredients that the user has input will be saved into Wishful Shrinking.

1. After the successful adding of the ingredient, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration (Add Recipe):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding the first feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

##### Aspect 2: Should we allow adding duplicated recipes ?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restricts to unique recipes.
  * Pros: Storage will contain unique items.
  * Cons: A uniqueness check must be done when adding recipe is performed, which could make the app run slower.

* **Alternative 2:** Allows duplicated items.
  * Pros: Users will not be restricted to adding unique recipes.
  * Cons: Storage will contain unnecessarily duplicated items.

#### Design Considerations (Add Ingredient):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with add recipe command.

##### Aspect 2: How do we successfully parse the ingredients the user has added with the optional ingredient quantity 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a quantity field in the Ingredient class as well as a IngredientParser class that parses the user ingredients that the user has input into an arraylist of Ingredient objects
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The parser may confuse ingredients that have prefixes that Wishful Shrinking uses to identify fields in the names, eg "-" or ","

### Eat recipe feature

Eat Recipe feature allows user to record their daily consumption. This feature will work with list consumption 
feature to output the total calories that user ate . 

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `EatRecipeCommand` extends `Command`
* `EatRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<EatRecipeCommand>`

Given bellow is the simplified step on how eat recipe is done:

Step 1: User input is change into command.
![EatRecipeStep1](images/implementation/EatRecipeStep1.png)

Step 2: Execute the command (make a copy of recipe from recipeList).
![EatRecipeStep2](images/implementation/EatRecipeStep2.png)

Step 3: Add the copy recipe into consumptionList.
![EatRecipeStep3](images/implementation/EatRecipeStep3.png)


The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(eatR 1)` API call:

![EatRecipeSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/EatRecipeSequence.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs eat recipe command to add a recipe to consumption list.

1. After successful parsing the user inputs, `EatRecipeCommand#method` method is called.

1. After successfully added recipe into consumption list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect 1: What are the informations to extract from a recipe and save in consumptionList 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves all the informations in recipe.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the recipe's data that going to use while listing consumption.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (Consumption list only save related information).
  * Cons: Not future proof (need to restructure the whole command if wanted to show more information from the recipe)

### List feature
List features (`List Recipes`, `List Ingredients` and `List Consumption`) allows user to list out all the item that was saved in the respective list.
List Consumption feature will also calculate and show the total calories consume. 

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `ListRecipeCommand`, `ListIngredientCommand` and `ListConsumptionCommand` extends `Command`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(recipes)`, `execute(fridge)` or `execute(calories)` API call:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/ListSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* userInput: `recipes`, `fridge` or `calories`
* ListCommand: `ListRecipeCommand`, `ListIngredientCommand` or `ListConusmptionCommand`
* getFilteredList(): `getFilteredRecipeList()`, `getFilteredIngredientList()` or `getFilteredConsumptionList()`
* Type: `Recipe`, `Ingredient` or `Consumption`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs the list command.

1. After successful parsing the user inputs, `ListRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`, `ListIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` or `ListConsumptionCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. After successfully fetch the consumption list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration(List Recipes):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

#### Design consideration(List Ingredients):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with list ingredient command and list consumption command.

#### Design consideration (List Consumption):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other list recipe command and list ingredient command.
##### Aspect 2: What are the informations to list from a recipe in consumption list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Listing recipe with images, name and calories.
  * Pros: Cleaner UI.
  * Cons: Other details that is not used become an extra data in memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Listing the whole recipe's information.
  * Pros: All the data saved are being used. 
  * Cons: Showing too much unimportant information.

### Delete feature
Delete features (`Delete Recipe`, `Delete Ingredient` and `Delete Consumption`) allows users to delete the saved item from the respective list.

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `DeleteRecipeCommand`, `DeleteIngredientCommand` and `DeleteConsumptionCommand` extends `Command`
* `DeleteRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteRecipeCommand>`
* `DeleteIngredientCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteIngredientCommand>`
* `DeleteConsumptionCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteConsumptionCommand>`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(deleteR 1)`, `execute(deleteF 1)` or `execute(deleteC 1)` API call:

![DeleteSequence](images/implementation/DeleteSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* delete: `deleteR`, `deleteF` or `deleteC`
* DeleteCommand: `DeleteRecipeCommand`, `DeleteIngredientCommand` or `DeleteConusmptionCommand`
* DeleteCommandParser: `DeleteRecipeCommandParser`, `DeleteIngredientCommandParser` or `DeleteConusmptionCommandParser`
* deleteType(1): `deleteRecipe(1)`, `deleteIngredient(1)` or `deleteConsumption(1)`
* remove(key): `removeRecipe(key)`, `removeIngredient(key)`, `removeConsumption(key)`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:
1. User inputs delete command to delete a specific item from the list.

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `DeleteRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`, `DeleteIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` or `DeleteConsumptionCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The item that user has specified by using index will be deleted from the respective list.

1. After the successful deleting of an `Consumption`, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration Recipe (Delete Recipe):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

#### Design consideration (Delete Ingredient/ Delete Consumption):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other deleting commands

### Edit feature
This edit feature (`Edit Recipe` and `Edit Ingredient`) allows users to edit an existing recipe/ingredient in the recipe list/firdge.

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `EditRecipeCommand` and `EditIngredientCommand` extends `Command`
* `EditRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<EditRecipeCommand>`
* `EditIngredientCommandParser` implements `Parser<EditIngredientCommand>`

The following sequence diagram shows how recommend operation works when `execute("editR 1 n/Pea soup")` or `execute("editF 1 i/tomato")` API call:

![EditSequence](images/implementation/EditSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* edit: `editR`or `editF`
* EditCommand: `EditRecipeCommand` or `EditIngredientCommand`
* EditCommandParser: `EditRecipeCommandParser` or `EditIngredientCommandParser`
* updateFilteredList(predicate): `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` or `updateFilteredIngredientList(predicate)`
* set(old, new): `setRecipe(oldRecipe, new Recipe)` or `setIngredient(oldIngredient, newIngredient)`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:
1. User inputs the edit command followed by an index specifying the recipe/ingredient to edit, then the values of fields to be modified.

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `EditRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`  or `EditIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The recipe/ingredient that the user has input will be saved into Wishful Shrinking's recipe list/fridge.

1. After the successful editing of the recipe, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations(Edit Recipe)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

#### Design Considerationsï¼ˆEdit Ingredient)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with edit recipe command.

#### Common Design Consideration
##### Aspect 1: How do we provide users with ease in editing an ingredient 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can directly edit the command that added the existing recipe/ingredient
  * Pros: Easy for users to edit recipe/ingredient.
  * Cons: Involves another command to set the command box to the command of the recipe/ingredient to edit.

* **Alternative 2:** User need to retype the existing ingredient's field if they want to modify from the
 existing ingredient
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Not user friendly.

### Get edit feature
Get edit features (Get Edit Recipe and Get Edit Ingredient) allows users to get the command of an existing recipe/ingredients to edit.

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `GetEditRecipeCommand` and `GetEditIngredientCommand` extends `Command`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(editR 1)` or `execute(editF 1)` API call:

![GetEditSequence](images/implementation/GetEditSequence.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* delete: `editR` or `editF`
* GetEditCommand: `GetEditRecipeCommand` or `GetEditIngredientCommand`
* GetEditCommandParser: `GetEditRecipeCommandParser` or `GetEditIngredientCommandParser`
* commandType: `recipeCommand` or `ingredientCommand`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:
1. User inputs the get edit command followed by an index specifying the recipe/ ingrdient to edit.

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `GetEditRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`  or `GetEditIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The edited recipe/ingredient that the user has input will be saved into Wishful Shrinking's recipe list/ fridge.

1. After the successful editing of the recipe, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to
 `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations (Get Edit Recipe)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other get edit commands.

#### Design Considerations (Get Edit Ingredient)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other get edit commands e.g get edit recipe command.

### Select Recipe feature

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `SelectRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. After successfully getting the recipe from the filtered recipe list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to
 `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands

### Search Recipe feature
Search features (Search Recipe and Search Ingredient) allow user to search for recipe/ingrdient in the recipe list/fridge based on the name.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Search Recipe would able to search based on tag or ingredient.
</div>

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:

The following sequence diagram shows how search recipe operation works when `execute("searchR n/burger")` or `execute("searchF avocado")`API call:

![SearchSequence](images/implementation/SearchSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* search: `searchR` or `searchF`
* info: `n/burger` or `avocado`
* updateFilteredList(predicate): `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` or `updateFilteredIngredientList(predicate)`
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. After the successful searching of the recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations (Search Recipe)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands

##### Aspect 2: How do we successfully search and filter the recipes based on the user' search 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can only search for recipes based on one fields at a time
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: User's cannot filter the recipes by two or three fields at once

* **Alternative 2:** User can search for recipes by all fields at once
  * Pros: Harder to implement.
  * Cons: User's can filter the recipes by two or three fields at once

#### Design Considerations (Search Ingredient)
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other searching commands e.g. search recipe.

### Recommend feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users to get recommended recipes that they are able to make with the ingredients in their fridge.

Substitutability is used in Command:
* `RecommendCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how recommend operation works when `execute("recommend")` API call:

1. User inputs the recommend command to get the recommended recipes.

1. After successful parsing of user input, the `RecommendCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The list of recommended recipes will be returned to the user.

1. After the successful recommending of recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect : How do we quickly and accurately compare ingredients in each recipe and the user's fridge
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compare the exact ingredients in each recipe to the users ingredients in the fridge
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: Slow to compare, the ingredients might not match if the spellings are different, or if the ingredient has similar names, eg mozarella and cheese. Other than that, if users do not input basic ingredients into their fridge, eg salt and pepper, the recipe might not get recommended to them.

### Clear feature
Clear features (`Clear Recipes`, `Clear Ingredients` and `Clear Consumption`) allows user to clear all the item that was saved in the respective list. 

#### Implementation
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `ClearRecipeCommand`, `ClearIngredientCommand` and `ClearConsumptionCommand` extends `Command`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(clearR)`, `execute(clearF)` or `execute(clearC)` API call:

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/ClearSequence.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** 

Some term in the sequence diagram above has changed to a common substitutable term:
* clear: `clearR`, `clearF` or `clearC`
* ClearCommand: `ClearRecipeCommand`, `ClearIngredientCommand` or `ClearConusmptionCommand`

#### Design consideration(Clear Recipes):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands.

#### Design consideration(CLear Ingredients):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with clear ingredient command and clear consumption command.

#### Design consideration (Clear Consumption):
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other clear recipe command and clear ingredient command.
