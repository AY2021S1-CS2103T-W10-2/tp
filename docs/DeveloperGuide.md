## 1. **Overview** <a id="1-overview"></a>
Welcome to the Wishful Shrinking Developer Guide! In this section, you will be given an overview of what Wishful
 Shrinking is about and what you can get out of reading this document. <br><br>
 
## 1.1 Introduction <a id="11-introduction"></a>
Wishful Shrinking is a desktop diet manager. It is an app that helps users **manage their on-hand ingredients
, organise personal recipes and track their diet**. Wishful Shrinking facilitates a **healthier diet** in three
 main ways: 
1. Provide a **source of healthy, customizable recipes** 
2. **Recommend recipes** to improve ease of home cooking 
3. **Track daily food and calorie** intake<br><br>

Wishful Shrinking targets **office workers** who tend to discount healthy eating. Office workers are also more
 familiar with desktop applications and typing and correspondingly, Wishful Shrinking is optimized for fast and efficient typers as it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the added beauty of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 Wishful Shrinking is available for the Linux, Unix, Windows and Mac OS operating systems.<br><br>
 
## 1.2 Purpose <a id="12-purpose"></a>
This developer guide provides in-depth documentation on how Wishful Shrinking is designed and implemented. This
 document contains detailed specifications on **program source code**, **design decisions**, and **architecture
  descriptions**. It will show how every part of the software works independently and as a whole to provide the
   best experience for the user. <br><br>

## 1.3 **Setting Up, Getting Started** <a id="13-setting-up-getting-started"></a>

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).<br><br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. **Design** <a id="2-design"></a>

### 2.1 Architecture <a id="21-architecture"></a>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below explains the high-level design of the App.
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

Given below is a quick overview of each component. <br><br>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary. <br><br>

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. <br><br>

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
 API `interface` mentioned in the previous point. <br><br>

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the **architecture components interact with each other** for the scenario
 where the user issues the command `deleteR 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

<br><br>
The sections below give more details on each component.<br><br>

### 2.2 UI Component <a id="22-ui-component"></a>

The **UI Component** class diagram is given below.
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java) <br><br>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel
`, `IngredientListPanel`, `ConsumptionListPanel` and `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework and JFoenix components. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) <br><br>

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.<br><br>

### 2.3 Logic Component <a id="23-logic-component"></a>
                                                                                                                   
The **Logic Component** class diagram is given below.                                                              
![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java) <br><br>

The `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface. <br>                              

1. `Logic` uses the `WishfulShrinkingParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. add recipe command updates the recipe list in Model).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions (e.g. displaying help to the user)<br><br>

### 2.4 Model Component <a id="24-model-component"></a>

The **Model Component** class diagram is given below.
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java) <br><br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:memo: **Note:** The lower level details of Recipe, Ingredient, and Consumption classes are represented
 by class diagrams attached in [Appendix C: Model Components](#7-appendix-model-component)

</div>

The `Model` component:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* Stores the Wishful Shrinking data.
* Exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>`, `ObservableList<Ingredient>` and `ObservableList<Consumption>` 
 that can be 'observed'. (e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists
 so that it automatically updates when the data in the lists change)
* Does not depend on any of the other three components: UI, Logic, and Storage. <br><br>


### 2.5 Storage Component <a id="25-storage-component"></a>

The **Storage Component** class diagram is given below.
![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java) <br><br>

The `Storage` component:
* Can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Can save the Wishful Shrinking data in json format and read it back. <br><br>

### 2.6 Common Classes <a id="26-common-classes"></a>

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package. <br><br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. **Implementation** <a id="3-implementation"></a>

This section describes some noteworthy details on the implementation of certain features.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:memo: 
**Note:** 
All lifeline with the destroy marker (X) should end with the mark (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
 lifeline continues beyond the mark (X) and reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:memo:

**Note:** :bell: can indicate either: <br>
- Source code with similar implementations have had their sequence or/and activity diagrams condensed into a
 single general diagram <br>
- Similar use case extensions are grouped to avoid repetitiveness  
</div>                 
                                                   
### 3.1 Add Features <a id="31-add-features"></a>
Add features - `Add Recipe` and `Add Ingredient` allows users to add recipes and ingredients into the recipe
 list or ingredient list respectively. <br><br>

#### 3.1.1 Implementation <a id="311-implementation"></a>
Command and Parser makes use of Substitutability:
* `AddRecipeCommand` and  `AddIngredientCommand` extends `Command`
* `AddRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddRecipeCommand>`
* `AddIngredientCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddIngredientCommand>` <br><br>

The following activity diagram shows how add operation generally works:
![AddActivityDiagram](images/implementation/activityDiagrams/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation generally works when a recipe is added: <br> 
`execute("addR n/Salad i/Veggies - 100g c/100 img/images/healthy3.jpg instr/Eat tag/healthy")` <br> 
or when an ingredient is added: <br> 
`execute("addF i/tomato")`

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/sequenceDiagrams/AddSequence.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bell: **Note** 

This is a condensed diagram. Several terms in the sequence diagram above have been substituted by a common term:<br>

Common Term | Recipe-specific term  | Ingredient-specific term
------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------   
add | `addR` | `addF`
AddCommandParser | `AddRecipeCommandParser` | `AddIngredientCommandParser`
AddCommand | `AddRecipeCommand` | `AddIngredientCommand`  
info | `"n/Salad i/Veggies - 100g c/100 img/images/healthy3.jpg instr/Eat tag/healthy"` | `"i/tomato"` 
add(type) | `addRecipe(type)` | `addIngredient(type)` 
type | `recipe` | `ingredient` 
 
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs add recipe or ingredient command specifying the fields to add, to add them into the recipe
 list or ingredient list respectively.

1. After successfully parsing the user's input, the `AddRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)` or `AddIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. The recipe or ingredient that the user has input will be saved into Wishful Shrinking.

1. After the successfully adding the recipe or ingredient, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and
 returned to `LogicManager`. <br><br>

#### 3.1.2 Design Consideration - **Add Recipe**: <a id="312-design-consideration-add-recipe"></a>
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature <a id="3121-aspect-1"></a>
* Workflow must be consistent with other commands. <br><br>

##### Aspect 2: Should we allow adding duplicate recipes <a id="3122-aspect-2"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Restricted to unique recipes.
  * Pros: Storage will contain unique recipes.
  * Cons: A uniqueness check must be done when the user adds recipe, which could make the app run slower.

* **Alternative 2:** Allows duplicate recipes.
  * Pros: Users will not be restricted to adding unique recipes.
  * Cons: Storage will be cluttered with duplicate recipes. <br><br>

#### 3.1.3 Design Considerations - **Add Ingredient**: <a id="313-design-consideration-add-ingredient"></a>
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature <a id="3131-aspect-1"></a>
* Workflow must be consistent with add recipe command. <br><br>

##### Aspect 2: How do we successfully parse the ingredients the user has added with the optional ingredient quantity <a id="3132-aspect-2"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Add a quantity field in the Ingredient class as well as a
 IngredientParser class that parses the user input ingredients into an arraylist of Ingredient objects
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The parser may confuse ingredients that have prefixes that Wishful Shrinking uses to identify fields in the names, eg "-" or ",". <br><br>
  
##### Aspect 3: Should we allow adding duplicate ingredients and stacking quantities <a id="3133-aspect-3"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Restricted to unique ingredients.
  * Pros: Storage will contain unique ingredients.
  * Cons: A uniqueness check must be done when the user adds ingredients, which could make the app run slower.

* **Alternative 2:** Allows duplicate ingredients and stacking of quantities.
  * Pros: Users will not be restricted to adding unique ingredients. If they add duplicate ingredients with quantities, the quantities will stack,
   making it easier for them to change each ingredient's quantity.
  * Cons: Storage will be cluttered with duplicate ingredients, harder to implement. <br><br>

### 3.2 Eat Recipe Feature <a id="32-eat-recipe-feature"></a>

Eat Recipe feature allows the user to record their daily consumption. This feature will work with list consumption 
feature to output the total calories that the user has eaten.  <br><br>

#### 3.2.1 Implementation <a id="321-implementation"></a>
Command and Parser makes use of Substitutability:
* `EatRecipeCommand` extends `Command`
* `EatRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<EatRecipeCommand>` <br><br>

The following activity diagram shows how eat recipe operation works:
![EatRecipeActivityDiagram](images/implementation/activityDiagrams/EatRecipeCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(eatR 1)` is called:
![EatRecipeSequenceDiagram](images/implementation/sequenceDiagrams/EatRecipeSequence.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs eat recipe command to add a recipe to the consumption list.

1. After successfully parsing the user's input, the `EatRecipeCommand#method` method is called.

1. After successfully adding the recipe into the consumption list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`. <br><br>

#### 3.2.2 Design Consideration: <a id="322-design-consideration"></a>
##### Aspect: What fields to extract from the eaten recipes to save in the Consumption List <a id="3221-aspect"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Saves all the information from each recipe.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the recipe's data that will be useful when listing consumption.
  * Pros: Will use less memory.
  * Cons: Not future proof as we need to restructure the whole command if want to show additional information from
   the recipe. <br><br>

### 3.3 List Features <a id="33-list-features"></a>
List features - `List Recipes`, `List Ingredients` and `List Consumption` allows the user to list out all the items
 that are saved in the recipe list, ingredient list or consumption list respectively.
The List Consumption feature will also calculate and show the total calories consumed so far.  <br><br>

#### 3.3.1 Implementation <a id="331-implementation"></a>
Command and Parser make use of Substitutability:
* `ListRecipeCommand`, `ListIngredientCommand` and `ListConsumptionCommand` extends `Command` <br><br>

The following activity diagram shows how list operation generally works: <br>
![ListActivityDiagram](images/implementation/activityDiagrams/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png)


The following sequence diagram shows how list operation works when `execute("recipes")`, `execute("fridge")` or
 `execute("calories")` is called:

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs the list command.

1. After successfully parsing the user's input, `ListRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`, `ListIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` or `ListConsumptionCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. After successfully getting the consumption list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to
 `LogicManager`. <br><br>

* Workflow must be consistent with other commands. <br><br>

##### Aspect 2: What information in the recipe is useful to display in the consumption list <a id="3342-aspect-2"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Listing each recipe with its image, name and calories.
  * Pros: Cleaner UI.
  * Cons: Other details that are not used become extra data in memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Listing each recipe's full information.
  * Pros: All the data saved is being used. 
  * Cons: Shows too much irrelevant information. <br><br>

### 3.4 Delete Features <a id="34-delete-features"></a>
Delete features - `Delete Recipe`, `Delete Ingredient` and `Delete Consumption` allows the users to delete saved items 
in the recipe list, ingredient list or consumption list respectively. <br><br>

##### Aspect 2: When the user deletes a recipe from the recipe list, should it also be deleted from the consumption list (if present) <a id="3422-aspect-2"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Store a copy of the recipe in the consumption list so that it is not deleted if the recipe is deleted from the recipe list.
    * Pros: Recipes consumed will be accurate.

1. After the successfully recommending recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`. <br><br>

#### 3.9.2 Design Considerations <a id="392-design-consideration"></a>
##### Aspect 1: How do we quickly and accurately compare ingredients between each recipe and the user's fridge <a id="3921-aspect-1"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Compare the exact ingredients in each recipe to the users ingredients in the fridge
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: Ingredients might not match if the spellings are different, or if the ingredient have similar names e.g.
   mozarella and cheese. Additionally, if users do not add basic ingredients into their fridge, e.g. salt
    and pepper, many recipes will not be recommended to them. <br><br>
    
##### Aspect 2: Should we take an ingredient's quantity into account when recommending recipes  <a id="3922-aspect-2"></a>
* **Alternative 1 (*current choice*):** Recommending recipes will not take ingredients' quantites into account
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The quantity of ingredients in the user's fridge might be less than the quantities in the recipe.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Recommending recipes will take ingredients' quantites into account and only recommend recipes
 whose ingredients have a lower quantity than the ingredients in the user's fridge
  * Pros: Harder to implement, user might not have input their ingredient's quantities.
  * Cons: Recommended recipes will be more accurate.  <br><br>

### 3.10 Clear Features <a id="310-clear-features"></a>

:bell: **Note**                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
This is a condensed diagram. Several terms in the sequence diagram above have been substituted by a common term:<br>

Common Term | Recipe-specific term  | Ingredient-specific term | Consumption-specific term                          
------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------       
clear | `"clearR"` | `"clearF"` | `"clearC"`
ClearCommand | `ClearRecipeCommand` | `ClearIngredientCommand` | `ClearConsumptionCommand`                                                                     
clearType() | `clearRecipe()` | `clearIngredient()` | `clearConsumption()`             

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves:

1. User inputs the clear command.

1. After successfully parsing the user's input, the `ClearRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)`, `ClearIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` or `ClearConsumptionCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

1. After successfully clearing the specified list, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to
 `LogicManager`. <br><br>

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained. <br><br>


### 6.2 Deleting a Recipe <a id="62-deleting-a-recipe"></a>

1. Deleting a recipe while all recipes are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all recipes using the `recipes` command. Multiple recipes in the list.

   1. Test case: `deleteR 1`<br>
      Expected: First recipe is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted recipe shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `deleteR 0`<br>
      Expected: No recipe is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deleteR`, `deleteR x`, `...` (where x is larger than the recipe list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous. <br><br>


### 6.3 Saving Data <a id="63-saving-data"></a>

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Test case: deleting name field from a recipe in the WishfulShrinking.json data file. <br>
      Expected: When the app is re-run, the corrupt data file will be detected and all the data in the file will be
       wiped out, causing the app to run with an empty data file.
       
   1. Test case: modify WishfulShrinking.json data file. <br>
      Expected: If data file is still in the correct format, the app will run with the new data file as normal
      . But if the data file becomes unreadable by the program, then all the data in the file will be wiped out, causing
       the app to run with an empty data file.
       
   1. Test case: delete WishfulShrinking.json data file. <br>
      Expected: If WishfulShrinking.json file cannot be found, the app will create the data file populated with
       sample recipes. <br><br>
