## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`,`IngredientListPanel`,`ConsumptionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework and JFoenix components. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WishfulShrinkingParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the wishful shrinking data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `WishfulShrinking`, which `Recipe` references. This allows `WishfulShrinking` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add recipe feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `AddRecipeCommand`. It extends `Command`.

* `AddRecipeCommand#execute()`: Do validity check then add recipe into model if passed.

These operations are exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#execute()`.
The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/AddRecipeSequence.png)

#### Design consideration:
* Workflow must be consistent with other adding commands e.g add ingredients, consumption.

### Eat recipe feature

Eat Recipe feature is used to record the user daily consumption. This feature will work with list consumption 
feature to output the total calories' user ate . 

#### Implementation
Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `EatRecipeCommand` extends `Command`
* `EatRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<EatRecipeCommand>`

Given bellow is the simplified step on how eat recipe is done:

Step 1:

User input is change into command.
![EatRecipeStep1](images/EatRecipeStep1.png)

Step 2:

Execute the command (make a copy of recipe from recipeList).
![EatRecipeStep2](images/EatRecipeStep2.png)

Step 3:

Add the copy recipe into consumptionList.
![EatRecipeStep3](images/EatRecipeStep3.png)


The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(eatR 1)` API call:

![EatRecipeSequenceDiagram](images/EatRecipeSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The lifeline for `EatRecipeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of 
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

1. `LogicManager` receive user input and undergoes logic operation for output.
1. `LogicManager` will pass the input to `WishfulShrinkingParser`.
1. `WishfulShrinkingParser` create `EatRecipeCommandParser` to parse and validate the user input.
1. `EatRecipeCommandParser` create `EatRecipeCommand` with successfully parsed input.
1. `LogicManager` execute `EatRecipeCommand`.
1. `EatRecipeCommand` get the list of recipe.
1. Get related recipe detail using the user input.
1. Pass the recipe to `Model` which responsible in adding it to consumption list.
1. `EatRecipeCommand` return a `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Delete a recipe in recipeList would not affect the consumptionList
</div>

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other adding commands e.g. add recipe and ingredient.
##### Aspect 2: What are the informations to extract from a recipe and save in consumptionList 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves all the informations in recipe.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the recipe's data that going to use while listing consumption.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (only the information being used is copied into consumptionList).
  * Cons: Not future proof (need to restructure the whole command if wanted to show more information from the recipe)

### List Consumption feature

List Consumption feature is used to list out all the recipes that user ate. This feature will also calculate 
the total calories. 

#### Implementation
Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `ListConsumptionCommand` extends `Command`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(calories)` API call:

![ListConsumptionSequenceDiagram](images/ListConsumptionSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `LogicManager` receive user input and undergoes logic operation for output.
1. `LogicManager` will pass the input to `WishfulShrinkingParser`.
1. `WishfulShrinkingParser` create `ListConsumptionCommandParser` to parse and validate the user input.
1. `LogicManager` execute `ListConsumptionCommand`.
1. `ListConsumptionCommand` get the consumption list.
1. `ListConsumptionCommand` return a `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other adding commands e.g. list recipe and ingredient.
##### Aspect 2: What are the informations to list from a recipe in consumption list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Listing recipe with name and calories.
  * Pros: Cleaner UI.
  * Cons: Other details that is not used become an extra data in memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Listing the whole recipe's information.
  * Pros: All the data saved are being used. 
  * Cons: Showing too much unimportant information.


### Delete recipe feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users to delete the recipes they have eaten in the calorie tracker.

Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `DeleteRecipeCommand` extends `Command`
* `DeleteRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteRecipeCommand>`

The following sequence diagram shows how eat recipe operation works when `execute(deleteR 1)` API call:

![DeleteRecipeSequence](images/DeleteRecipeSequence.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteRecipeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of 
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

1. `LogicManager` receive user input and undergoes logic operation for output.

##### Aspect 2: What are the information to list a recipe from a list of recipes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Listing recipe with name.
  * Pros: Cleaner UI.
  * Cons: Other details that is not used become an extra data in memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Listing the whole recipe's information.
  * Pros: All the data saved are being used.
  * Cons: Showing too much unimportant information.


### List Recipe Feature

#### Implementation

1. `LogicManager` execute `ListRecipesCommand`.
1. `ListRecipesCommand` get the list of recipes.
1. `ListRecipesCommand` return a `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other listing commands e.g. fridge and calories.


### Add Ingredient feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users to add ingredients into the fridge.

Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `AddIngredientCommand` extends `Command`
* `AddIngredientCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddIngredientCommand>`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![AddIngredientSequence](images/AddIngredientSequence.png)

Step 1:
User inputs the add ingredient command to add ingredients into the fridge.

Step 2:
After successful parsing of user input, the `AddIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3:
The ingredients that the user has input will be saved into Wishful Shrinking's fridge of ingredients.

Step 4:
After the successful adding of the ingredient, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other adding commands e.g. add recipe and eat recipe for consumption.

##### Aspect 2: How do we successfully parse the ingredients the user has added with the optional ingredient quantity 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a quantity field in the Ingredient class as well as a IngredientParser class that parses the user ingredients that the user has input into an arraylist of Ingredient objects
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: The parser may confuse ingredients that have prefixes that Wishful Shrinking uses to identify fields in the names, eg "-" or ","

### List Ingredients Feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows user to list out all the ingredients that is saved in the fridge.

Substitutability is used in Command:
* `ListIngredientCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how list ingredients operation works when `execute(fridge)` API call:

![ListIngredientsSequence](images/ListIngredientsSequence.png)

1. User inputs the list ingredient command to show all ingredients from the ingredient list.

2. After successful parsing of user input, the `ListIngredientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

3. After successfully generating a list of recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to
 `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other listing commands e.g. fridge and calories.




### Search Recipe feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users search for recipes in the recipe list based on the name, tags or ingredients.

Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `SearchRecipeCommand` extends `Command`
* `SearchRecipeCommandParser` implements `Parser<SearchRecipeCommand>`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![SearchRecipeSequence](images/SearchRecipeSequence.png)

Step 1:
User inputs the search recipe command to search for the recipes they want.

Step 2:
After successful parsing of user input, the `SearchRecipeCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3:
The list of recipes that fit the user's search will be returned to the user.

Step 4:
After the successful searching of the recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other searching commands e.g. search recipe.

##### Aspect 2: How do we successfully search and filter the recipes based on the user' search 
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can only search for recipes based on one fields at a time
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: User's cannot filter the recipes by two or three fields at once

* **Alternative 2:** User can only search for recipes by all fields at once
  * Pros: Harder to implement.
  * Cons: User's can filter the recipes by two or three fields at once

### Delete Consumption feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users to delete the recipes they have eaten in the calorie tracker.

Substitutability is used in Command and Parser:
* `DeleteConsumptionCommand` extends `Command`
* `DeleteConsumptionCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteConsumptionCommand>`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![DeleteConsumptionSequence](images/DeleteConsumptionSequence.png)

Step 1:
User inputs the delete consumption command to delete the recipes eaten in the calorie tracker.

Step 2:
After successful parsing of user input, the `DeleteConsumptionCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3:
The recipe that the user has specified will be deleted from the consumption list.

Step 4:
After the successful deleting of recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect 1: Concern while adding a new feature
* Workflow must be consistent with other deleting commands e.g. delete recipe and delete ingredient.

### Recommend feature

#### Implementation
This feature allows users to get recommended recipes that they are able to make with the ingredients in their fridge.

Substitutability is used in Command:
* `RecommendCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![RecommendSequence](images/RecommendSequence.png)

Step 1:
User inputs the recommend command to get the recommended recipes.

Step 2:
After successful parsing of user input, the `RecommendCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

Step 3:
The list of recommended recipes will be returned to the user.

Step 4:
After the successful recommending of recipes, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect : How do we quickly and accurately compare ingredients in each recipe and the user's fridge
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compare the exact ingredients in each recipe to the users ingredients in the fridge
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: Slow to compare, the ingredients might not match if the spellings are different, or if the ingredient has similar names, eg mozarella and cheese. Other than that, if users do not input basic ingredients into their fridge, eg salt and pepper, the recipe might not get recommended to them.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 recipes and ingredients without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Reserve an amount of 5MB memory for the baseline recipe data.
4.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.  
5.  Searching-related features might be slow if there are more than 2000 recipes or ingredients in the database.
6.  The application does not need internet connection.
7.  The application uses local database.
8.  The local database will be immediately updated after each updating command.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Fridge**: A personalised storage that contains all the ingredients that a user has
* **Recipe**: A set of cooking instructions that describes how to prepare a meal and ingredients required
* **Ingredient**: Foods that can be used to prepare a particular dish according to a recipe
* **Consumption**: A counter which calculates and displays the calorie intake of a user based on the recipes consumed
